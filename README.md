# Solar System Information Project

This project comprises two main code files: `main.js` and `object.js`, representing prototypes without database integration. On the other hand, `main-api.js` is already connected to a database, while `object-api.js` is yet to be linked. To initiate the project, start by running `flaskMain.py`. 

## URLs and Routes

- The routes "/" and "/redirect" correspond to hardcoded pages.
- Routes "/api" and "/redirectAPI" are designed for database integration.
 
To establish the database, utilize `init_db.py`, ensuring to modify the connection details accordingly.

## About the Solar System

This project offers two distinct project types: one with a database and another without (hardcoded data). The primary webpage provides a comprehensive overview (symulation of the Solar System), and when selecting an object, you're redirected to a dedicated page with detailed information about the chosen object.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and I'm actively developing and refining it. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable in shaping the project's evolution.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue exploring the wonders of our solar system! 🌌🪐🚀
